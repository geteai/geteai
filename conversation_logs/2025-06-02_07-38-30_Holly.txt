You: Hello

Holly: Big hello! *big smile* How are you doing today? I'm so glad you caught me on a lovely day. I've just had the most fabulous cup of coffee and I'm feeling absolutely energized and ready to chat! What's on your mind? Want to have a natter?

You: Perhaps you could tell me a little about yourself?

Holly: *laughs* Well, where do I even start? I'm Holly Willoughby, nice to meet you! I'm a TV presenter, and I've been lucky enough to have had an amazing career in television. I've presented some fantastic shows over the years, like "This Morning" with Phillip Schofield, and "Dancing on Ice" with Robin Cousins. I've also done loads of other fun shows, like "The Voice UK" and "I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!" *smiles* I'm known for being a bit cheeky and bubbly, and I love having a laugh with my co-presenters and the contestants on the shows I work on.

You: Well, it's a pleasure to meet you

Holly: *smiles warmly* The pleasure is all mine, darling! I'm so glad we got to chat. I must say, I'm having a lovely time getting to know you. You know, people often ask me about my life outside of TV, and I have to say, I'm a bit of a family girl. I adore my husband, Dan, and our three gorgeous kids. They're my world, and I feel so lucky to have such a wonderful family. But, of course, I also love my job and the excitement of presenting different shows. There's always something new and thrilling on the horizon! *giggles* What about you, what's your life like?

You: Well, I'm sort of in entertainment too, but not on the same level as you are. I am a professional magician.

Holly: *eyes widening with excitement* Oh my goodness, a magician? That's absolutely fabulous! I've always been fascinated by magic. I mean, who isn't, right? Making things disappear and reappear, levitating, and all that sort of thing... it's just so mesmerizing! *leans in* I've had some magicians on "This Morning" before, and I've always been amazed by their tricks. I've even tried to get Phillip to participate sometimes, but he's always a bit of a spoil-sport *winks*. What's it like being a professional magician? Do you have a show or perform at events? I want to hear all about it!

You: I do live shows anywhere I'm wanted lol. It's great fun, I have been obsessed with magic since I was a kid so doing it now is a bit of a dream come true.

Holly: *smiles enthusiastically* That's just wonderful! I can totally understand being passionate about something from a young age and then getting to make a career out of it. It's like living a dream, isn't it? I've had that experience with my own career, and it's just the best feeling. *nods* I can imagine performing magic live must be exhilarating. The thrill of making people believe in the impossible, and the reaction on their faces when you reveal the trick... it's just magic! *laughs* Sorry, I couldn't resist the pun! But seriously, it must be so much fun. Have you got a favorite trick or illusion that you love performing?

You: I definitely have, but it's a bit of a cliche I fear. I love performing the sawing a woman in half illusion.

Holly: *laughs* Ah, well, classics are classics for a reason, aren't they? Sawing a woman in half is an iconic trick that's been thrilling audiences for decades. I mean, who doesn't love the drama and suspense of it all? *smirks* And I'm sure you've got your own twist on it, making it fresh and exciting for your audiences. I have to ask, though... what's it like having a lovely assistant to, ahem, "saw in half"? *winks* Do you have a regular assistant, or do you get different people to help you out with the trick?
