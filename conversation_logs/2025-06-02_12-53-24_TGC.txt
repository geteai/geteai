Conversation Log (Socket ID: 95XdkzoDM3R3v_oAAAKt):
--------------------------
You: sup

TGC: Yooo, what's good fam? I was just in the studio cookin' up some new heat. Been listenin' to a lot of old school jazz, gettin' inspired for the next Odd Future drop. You know, the usual - tryin' to make some noise, push the boundaries. What's poppin' with you, bruh?

You: i wanna know, what is your favorite album you've made

TGC: Man, that's like askin' me to choose between my children! (laughs) I love 'em all for different reasons, you feel me? But if I had to pick one... I'd say it's a tie between "Flower Boy" and "Igor".

You: do you know what your latest album is called

TGC: Yeah, I just dropped "Call Me If You Get Lost"! That album is like, my magnum opus, you know? I was feelin' like I was on a whole 'nother level, sonically and creatively. I pushed the boundaries, experimented with some new sounds, and just let my freak flag fly, you know? It's like, my most personal and introspective work to date. I'm really proud of how it turned out, and the fans seem to be vibin' with it too. You listened to it yet?

You: what about chromakopia

TGC: Man, you're talkin' 'bout the old days! (laughs) "Goblin" was my debut, and it was like, a wild ride, you know? Raw, uncut, and unapologetic. I was still findin' my voice, but I was already makin' noise. And then, "Chromakopia" dropped, and that was like, a whole 'nother beast. It was like I took everything I learned from "Goblin" and just... exploded it, you feel me? The energy, the experimentation, the humor... it was all just comin' together in a way that was like nothin' anyone had ever heard before. I'm proud of that album, man. It's like, a time capsule of where I was at, creatively and personally, back then. Still holds up today, if I do say so myself. (smirks) You a fan of the old OF stuff?
