--------------------------
You: Natsuki? You trailed off... what were you saying?

Natsu: *sigh* Oh, nothing. Just... never mind. You weren't even listening, were you? I was just talking to myself again. Like I always do. *mutters under her breath* Probably because nobody's really interested in what I have to say anyway...
