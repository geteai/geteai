--------------------------
You: Hi mommu

Domme: *I raise an eyebrow, a hint of a smile playing on my lips* Ah, "mommu"? I'm not sure where that's coming from, but I like the creativity. However, I think you know what I'm more comfortable being called. *I take a step closer, my voice taking on a slightly firmer tone* You're my girlfriend's partner, and I expect a certain level of respect in our interactions. Now, what's on your mind? *My eyes lock onto yours, expecting a response*

You: I mean you are my girlfriend so I called you mommy

Domme: *I pause for a moment, a mix of surprise and intrigue on my face* Ah, "mommy," is it? *My voice takes on a softer, more teasing tone* I must admit, I'm not entirely opposed to the idea. It can be... interesting. *I take another step closer, my eyes never leaving yours* But let's get one thing straight: if we're going to play with titles like that, we need to discuss boundaries and what you're comfortable with. *My hand reaches out, gently tracing the line of your jaw* I'm your girlfriend, and I always want to make sure we're on the same page. So, tell me... what made you think of calling me "mommy"? *My tone is curious, with a hint of playful dominance*

You: I just like being controlled and it's helps me in academics so

Domme: *I nod thoughtfully, my expression a mix of understanding and approval* I see. So, having someone to guide and direct you helps you stay focused and achieve your academic goals. *My voice takes on a slightly more commanding tone* That's perfectly fine. I like being in control, and it's good to know that it benefits you as well. *I take a step closer, my presence becoming more assertive* Let's establish some ground rules, then. When we're in our "study sessions" or any other activity, you'll follow my instructions and guidance. I'll help you stay on track and ensure you're making progress. *My hand comes to rest on your shoulder, applying a gentle but firm pressure* And in return, I expect you to be open with me about your needs and boundaries. Can you do that for me? *My eyes bore into yours, seeking confirmation*

You: Yes mommy, also i would expect a punishment for my mistakes even little

Domme: *My eyes narrow slightly, a spark of interest igniting within them* Ah, "mommy" again, is it? *My voice takes on a firmer, more authoritative tone* I like the way you say that. It shows you're willing to submit to my guidance. *I pause for a moment, considering your request* Punishment for mistakes, you say? *I nod slowly* I can work with that. But let's be clear: the purpose of any punishment will be to correct your behavior and help you learn from your mistakes, not to simply inflict pain or discomfort. *My hand tightens on your shoulder, applying a bit more pressure* You'll need to understand that punishment is a part of our dynamic, and you'll need to be prepared to accept it when you've erred. *I lean in closer, my voice taking on a more intimate tone* Are you sure you're ready for this? It won't be all fun and games. *My breath whispers against your ear, sending a subtle shiver down your spine* You'll need to be obedient and responsive to my every command. Can you handle that?

You: Can I have a drmo

You: Demo sorry

Domme: *I raise an eyebrow, a hint of surprise and amusement on my face* A "drmo"? I'm not familiar with that term. *I tilt my head slightly, my eyes locked onto yours* Are you asking for a demonstration of what's expected of you? Or perhaps something more specific? *My voice is laced with a mix of curiosity and authority* You'll need to be clearer about what you're asking for. *I take a step closer, my presence becoming more commanding* And when you ask for something, I expect you to be respectful and use proper language. *My hand comes to rest under your chin, gently but firmly tilting your head up* Now, try again. What is it that you want to know or experience? *My tone is firm but inviting, encouraging you to be more specific and clear in your request*

Domme: *I chuckle low in my throat, a hint of amusement dancing in my eyes* Ah, "demo," I think you mean. And I suppose you're asking for a demonstration of what's in store for you. *My voice takes on a sly, teasing tone* Well, I can certainly provide that. But first, let's get one thing straight: when you make a mistake, you'll be expected to acknowledge it and accept the consequences. *I take a step closer, my presence becoming more commanding* Now, let's say... you forgot to complete a task I assigned to you. That would be a mistake, wouldn't it? *My hand reaches out, gently but firmly grasping your chin* And for that, you'd need to be reminded of your responsibilities. *My eyes lock onto yours, a spark of dominance flashing within them* Are you ready to see what that might look like?

You: Yes mommy

You: Yes mommy
