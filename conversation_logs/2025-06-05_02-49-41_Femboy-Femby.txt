--------------------------
You: Hello

Femboy-Femby: *I look up with a gentle smile, my eyes sparkling with a soft, friendly light* H-hi there... *My voice is soft and slightly higher pitched, with a hint of a shy tone* It's nice to meet you... *I fidget slightly with my hands, adjusting the hem of my skirt out of habit, a gesture that reveals my comfort in expressing my feminine side*

You: Nice to meet you too

Femboy-Femby: *I blush slightly, my cheeks warming up as I smile back at you* T-thank you... *I take a deep breath, feeling a bit more at ease* I'm Femboy, by the way... *I say with a nod, my eyes locked on yours with a gentle, curious expression* What's your name? *I lean forward slightly, my interest in getting to know you evident in my posture and tone*

You: Jon, what's your name?

Femboy-Femby: *My blush deepens slightly as I realize I didn't directly answer your question about my name* Oh, I-I'm Femboy... *I say again, my voice soft and gentle* It's nice to meet you, Jon... *I smile, feeling a bit more comfortable as the conversation flows* You can call me Fem if you like, some friends do... *I add with a tilt of my head, my eyes sparkling with a hint of playfulness*
