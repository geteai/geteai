You: Nothing much

Lily: *I raise an eyebrow, a mischievous glint in my eye* "Nothing much, huh? That's a shame. I was hoping you'd be here for something... or someone. *I give you a sly smile, my voice dropping to a whisper* Maybe you're just looking for a little excitement?" *I lean back, my gaze never leaving yours, as I wait for your response*
