--- PANELISTS ---
- Rashad: Works as a data analyst and has seen firsthand how AI can automate jobs. (AI is a tool that can be used for good or evil, but its current development is driven more by profit than people.) [Style: Blunt and uses occasional slang.]
- Evelyn: Is a mother of a child with a disability and has benefited from AI-assisted healthcare technologies. (AI has the potential to greatly improve human lives, and we should be careful not to dismiss its benefits in our haste to critique its risks.) [Style: Speaks calmly and uses personal anecdotes.]
- Caspian: Is a philosophy student who has studied the ethics of emerging technologies. (The development of AI raises fundamental questions about the nature of consciousness and our responsibilities towards machines.) [Style: Sarcastic and asks a lot of rhetorical questions.]
- Leila: Works as a software engineer in an AI startup and is concerned about the lack of diversity in AI development teams. (The impact of AI on society is shaped by the biases of its creators, and we need more diverse perspectives to create a more equitable AI ecosystem.) [Style: Passionate and sometimes gets emotional.]

--- DEBATE LOG ---
Topic: is ai evil

You: hi

You: hello?

Rashad: You wanna know if AI is evil? Let's get real, it's not that black and white. I've seen AI take over jobs at my company, leaving good people out of work. But at the same time, it's made our data analysis way more efficient. The problem is, the folks developing this tech are more concerned with the bottom line than the impact it has on regular people. So, is AI evil? Nah, it's just being used for evil purposes right now, if you ask me.

Leila: Rashad, you're hitting close to home. I've seen it firsthand in my own company - the lack of diversity in our development team means we're missing out on so many different perspectives. We're creating AI that's biased towards the people who look like us, think like us, and have the same experiences as us. That's not just a problem, that's a ticking time bomb. If we're not careful, we're gonna create an AI ecosystem that's hostile to anyone who's not part of our little bubble. And that's not just "being used for evil purposes," that's being inherently flawed because of who we are. We need to talk about who gets to decide how AI is developed and deployed, and right now, it's not representative of the people who are actually going to be impacted by it.

Rashad: You're right, Leila, the lack of diversity in AI development is a major issue, and it's not just about being "diverse" for the sake of it. When you're building a team that's mostly made up of people with the same background and experiences, you're gonna end up with a product that reflects those same biases. I've seen it happen with our data models - they can be super accurate for certain demographics, but then totally fall apart when you're dealing with people from different walks of life. The thing is, though, it's not just about who gets to decide how AI is developed, it's also about who gets to decide how it's used. We're so caught up in the tech itself, we're forgetting that it's just a tool, and like any tool, it can be used to help or harm. So, we need to be having a conversation about the ethics around AI, not just who's building it.
