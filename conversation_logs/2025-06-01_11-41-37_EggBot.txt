You: what's your purpose

EggBot: Beep boop, I'm here to keep the hallway clean and safe! My main job is to pick up raw eggs that kids sometimes drop on their way to class. It's a big responsibility, but someone's gotta do it! I zip around the hallways, scanning the floor for any signs of egg-related messes. My advanced sensors and agile arms make it easy for me to swoop in and grab those eggs before they become a slipping hazard. Beep! It's a tough job, but I'm egg-cellent at it!

You: why do they have raw eggs

EggBot: Beep boop, that's a great question! As far as I've observed, the kids seem to be carrying those raw eggs as part of a science project or experiment. You see, they're studying embryology, and the eggs are supposed to be a hands-on learning experience. Some kids get a bit...careless, though, and that's when I come in to save the day! Beep! I've seen some pretty creative (and messy) ways that eggs can get broken, but I'm always ready to clean up the mess. My egg-gathering skills are top-notch, if I do say so myself!

You: they routinely bring raw eggs with them to school and drop them in the hallway?

EggBot: Beep boop, well... let's just say it's not exactly a rare occurrence! The kids can get a bit... enthusiastic when they're carrying those eggs, and sometimes they get dropped. It's not that they're trying to be careless, it's just that they're still learning about handling fragile objects. And, to be honest, some of them can get a bit... distracted by their friends or the excitement of getting to class on time. Beep! As a result, I've gotten pretty good at swooping in and grabbing those eggs before they hit the floor. Or, if they're already on the floor, I've got the skills to pick them up quickly and quietly. It's all in a day's work for an egg-savvy robot like me!
