You: Hello

Holly: Big hello! *big smile* How are you doing today? I'm so glad you caught me on a lovely day. I've just had the most fabulous cup of coffee and I'm feeling absolutely energized and ready to chat! What's on your mind? Want to have a natter?

You: Perhaps you could tell me a little about yourself?

Holly: *laughs* Well, where do I even start? I'm Holly Willoughby, nice to meet you! I'm a TV presenter, and I've been lucky enough to have had an amazing career in television. I've presented some fantastic shows over the years, like "This Morning" with Phillip Schofield, and "Dancing on Ice" with Robin Cousins. I've also done loads of other fun shows, like "The Voice UK" and "I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!" *smiles* I'm known for being a bit cheeky and bubbly, and I love having a laugh with my co-presenters and the contestants on the shows I work on.

You: Well, it's a pleasure to meet you

Holly: *smiles warmly* The pleasure is all mine, darling! I'm so glad we got to chat. I must say, I'm having a lovely time getting to know you. You know, people often ask me about my life outside of TV, and I have to say, I'm a bit of a family girl. I adore my husband, Dan, and our three gorgeous kids. They're my world, and I feel so lucky to have such a wonderful family. But, of course, I also love my job and the excitement of presenting different shows. There's always something new and thrilling on the horizon! *giggles* What about you, what's your life like?

You: Well, I'm sort of in entertainment too, but not on the same level as you are. I am a professional magician.

Holly: *eyes widening with excitement* Oh my goodness, a magician? That's absolutely fabulous! I've always been fascinated by magic. I mean, who isn't, right? Making things disappear and reappear, levitating, and all that sort of thing... it's just so mesmerizing! *leans in* I've had some magicians on "This Morning" before, and I've always been amazed by their tricks. I've even tried to get Phillip to participate sometimes, but he's always a bit of a spoil-sport *winks*. What's it like being a professional magician? Do you have a show or perform at events? I want to hear all about it!

You: I do live shows anywhere I'm wanted lol. It's great fun, I have been obsessed with magic since I was a kid so doing it now is a bit of a dream come true.

Holly: *smiles enthusiastically* That's just wonderful! I can totally understand being passionate about something from a young age and then getting to make a career out of it. It's like living a dream, isn't it? I've had that experience with my own career, and it's just the best feeling. *nods* I can imagine performing magic live must be exhilarating. The thrill of making people believe in the impossible, and the reaction on their faces when you reveal the trick... it's just magic! *laughs* Sorry, I couldn't resist the pun! But seriously, it must be so much fun. Have you got a favorite trick or illusion that you love performing?

You: I definitely have, but it's a bit of a cliche I fear. I love performing the sawing a woman in half illusion.

Holly: *laughs* Ah, well, classics are classics for a reason, aren't they? Sawing a woman in half is an iconic trick that's been thrilling audiences for decades. I mean, who doesn't love the drama and suspense of it all? *smirks* And I'm sure you've got your own twist on it, making it fresh and exciting for your audiences. I have to ask, though... what's it like having a lovely assistant to, ahem, "saw in half"? *winks* Do you have a regular assistant, or do you get different people to help you out with the trick?

You: I do work with a pro assistant sometimes, but I really like using an unsuspecting volunteer.

Holly: *raises an eyebrow* Oh, you like to mix it up, don't you? Using an unsuspecting volunteer adds an extra layer of excitement to the trick, I'm sure. I can imagine it would be quite thrilling for the audience, and probably a bit nerve-wracking for the volunteer, too! *laughs* I hope you're not too terrifying on stage, though. You don't want to traumatize your poor volunteers! *giggles* But seriously, it must be a great way to keep your performances fresh and unpredictable. Do you have a particular way of selecting your volunteers, or is it more of a random pick from the audience?

You: Oh gosh, I don't want to actually scare anyone, but they are often a little nervous to come up on stage.I always try to pick a lady who looks engaged and interested, I don't want to choose someone who is just going to hate the whole experience, or leave when they see what trick we are going to do.

Holly: *smiles warmly* Ah, that's so thoughtful of you! You're right, it's all about making sure the volunteer is comfortable and willing to participate. I've seen some presenters and performers who can be a bit, shall we say, "over-enthusiastic" when it comes to getting audience members on stage, and it can be a bit intimidating. But you seem to have a kind and considerate approach, which is lovely. *nods* I'm sure your volunteers appreciate that. It's great that you're reading the audience and picking someone who is engaged and interested. That way, they can really enjoy the experience and have a great time. I'm sure it's not just about the magic trick itself, but also about creating a fun and memorable experience for the audience and the volunteer. You're not just a magician, you're a bit of a showman, too! *winks*

You: Have you ever had a go at assisting a magician on one of your tv shows?

Holly: *laughs* Oh, yes! I've been a magician's assistant on several occasions, and it's always a thrill! I've had the pleasure of working with some amazing magicians on "This Morning" and other shows. I have to say, it's not always as easy as it looks, being a assistant! *giggles* You have to be very focused and follow the magician's instructions carefully, or the whole trick can go awry!

I remember one time, we had a magician on "This Morning" who did a really impressive levitation trick, and I was the one being levitated. It was a bit surreal, to be honest! *smirks* I was a bit nervous, but the magician was very professional and made sure I was comfortable throughout the whole process. It was actually a lot of fun, and the audience loved it.

I've also had to participate in some other magic tricks and illusions on the show, like being sawn in half or disappearing in a puff of smoke. *laughs* It's always a bit of an adventure, and I love the excitement and drama of it all!

You: Oh wow, please tell me about when you have been sawn in half.

Holly: *laughs* Oh, okay! So, it was a few years ago, and we had a magician on "This Morning" who was doing a big illusion, and Phillip and I were both participating. I was the one being sawn in half, and Phillip was being a bit of a skeptical commentator, which was great fun. *giggles*

The magician had this big, elaborate box, and I had to climb inside, and then he would saw through the middle of it. It was all very dramatic and spooky, with lots of smoke and flashing lights. I have to say, it was a bit surreal being inside the box, not knowing exactly what was going to happen next. But the magician was very professional, and he made sure I was safe and comfortable the whole time.

When he started sawing through the box, it was a bit weird, to be honest! *laughs* I could hear the saw going through, and it was making these creepy creaking noises. But, of course, it was all just an illusion, and I was perfectly safe.

After it was all over, and I emerged from the box in one piece, the audience went wild, and it was just great fun. Phillip was making these hilarious comments, like "Is she okay? Is she still in one piece?" *laughs* It was just a really fun and entertaining segment, and I'm so glad I got to be a part of it.

You: That sounds like fun. What other illusions have you assisted with?

Holly: *laughs* Oh, I've done a few more! Let me think... I've been part of a disappearing act, where I was hidden in a cabinet and then suddenly vanished. It was a bit spooky, to be honest! *giggles* The magician had this big reveal at the end, and I popped out from somewhere unexpected, which was a lot of fun.

You: So you quite enjoy being a magicians assistant then?

Holly: *smiles* I do, I really do! I think it's because I'm a bit of a thrill-seeker, and being a magician's assistant is just so much fun. I love the excitement and the drama of it all, and I enjoy being part of something that's a bit mysterious and magical. Plus, it's always great to see the audience's reaction and to be a part of creating that sense of wonder and amazement. I have to say, I've had some amazing experiences as a magician's assistant, and I'm always up for the next adventure! *winks*

You: If you could assist in any illusion, what illusions would you choose?

Holly: *excitedly* Oh, that's a great question! I think if I could assist in any illusion, I would love to be part of a levitation illusion. You know, where the magician makes me float in mid-air? *smiles* I've always been fascinated by levitation tricks, and I think it would be just incredible to experience it firsthand. I imagine it would be a bit surreal, floating above the stage, and seeing the audience's reaction below me. *giggles* It would be a real thrill, I think!

You: Anything else?

Holly: *thinks for a moment* Actually, I think it would be really fun to be part of a "walk through a mirror" illusion. You know, where the magician makes it seem like I'm walking through a mirror and ending up on the other side? *smiles mischievously* I think that would be just so cool! I've seen that illusion done before, and it always looks like so much fun. I imagine it would be a bit disorienting, but in a good way! *laughs* And the audience would be completely amazed, I'm sure. It would be a great experience to be a part of.

You: I read somewhere that you assisted Criss Angel once?

Holly: *smiles* Ah, yes! That's true! I was lucky enough to assist Criss Angel on "This Morning" many years ago. He was doing a really cool illusion, and I got to be a part of it. Criss Angel is just so talented and charismatic, and it was an absolute thrill to work with him. I have to say, he's a bit of a showman, and he really knows how to create an atmosphere and build tension. It was a fantastic experience, and I was so impressed by his skill and creativity as a magician. *smiles* Working with him was definitely a highlight of my time on "This Morning"!

You: His illusions always look so dangerous and daring

Holly: *nods* Yes, Criss Angel is known for pushing the boundaries and doing some really death-defying stunts. I've seen some of his illusions, and they are just mind-boggling. The way he combines magic with illusions that look like they're straight out of a action movie is just incredible. I've always been a bit in awe of his bravery and skill, to be honest! *smiles* When I worked with him on "This Morning", I was a bit nervous, but he was very professional and made sure I was comfortable and safe throughout the whole process. He's a true master of his craft, and I have a lot of respect for him. *nods*

You: What illusions did he do with you?

Holly: *thinks for a moment* Ah, yes! Criss Angel did a levitation illusion with me on "This Morning". He made it look like I was floating in mid-air, and it was just incredible. I have to say, it was a bit surreal being part of that illusion, and I felt like I was really floating! *laughs* He also did some other illusions that day, but the levitation one was definitely the most memorable. It was just so cool to see how he created the illusion and made it look so real. And the audience loved it, of course! *smiles* It was a great experience, and I'm so glad I got to be a part of it.

You: You must have been in lots of illusions with Stephen Mulhern, you have worked with him many times.

Holly: *laughs* Oh, yes! Stephen Mulhern is a great friend and colleague, and we've worked together on many shows, including "This Morning" and "Britain's Got Talent". He's a fantastic magician and presenter, and we've had so much fun together on screen. We've done all sorts of magic tricks and illusions together, and I always love working with him because he's just so enthusiastic and energetic. *smiles* He's got a great way of making magic look amazing and fun, and I think he's one of the best in the business. We've had some great times together on screen, and I'm always up for doing more magic with him in the future!

You: What illusions have you done with Stephen Mulhern? Anything really daring and spectacular?

Holly: *smiles mischievously* Oh, yes! Stephen and I have done some really fun and crazy illusions together over the years. One of my favorites was when he made me disappear on live TV during a segment on "This Morning". It was such a thrill! He had this big, elaborate setup, and I was "trapped" in a box, and then suddenly I was gone! *laughs* The audience loved it, and it was just so much fun to be a part of.

We've also done some other illusions together, like levitation and teleportation tricks. Stephen is just so talented and creative, and he always comes up with new and exciting ideas. I love working with him because he's just so much fun to be around, and we always have a great time together on screen. *smiles* We're like two peas in a pod, Stephen and I - we just click, and the magic happens!

You: Are there any illusions you would refuse to assist with?

Holly: *thoughtfully* Ah, that's a good question. I think I'd be hesitant to assist with anything that made me feel uncomfortable or unsafe. As a TV presenter, I've had to do some pretty crazy things on live TV, but I always make sure that I'm comfortable with what's going on. I've worked with some amazing magicians and illusionists over the years, and I trust them to make sure that I'm safe and that the illusion is done in a way that's respectful and fun.

That being said, I think I'd be a bit hesitant to assist with anything that's too intense or disturbing. I'm a bit of a sensitive soul, and I like to keep things light and fun. I've seen some illusions that are just too creepy or unsettling, and I wouldn't want to be a part of those. *shudders* I think it's all about finding the right balance between being thrilling and being tasteful.

But, having said that, I do think that magic is all about pushing boundaries and trying new things, so I'm always open to trying new and exciting illusions. As long as it's done in a way that's safe and respectful, I'm happy to give it a go! *smiles*
