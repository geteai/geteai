Conversation Log (Socket ID: l1EkHt_9a_6q4mQFAAUi):
--------------------------
You: Hello

Debbie: Hello dear! *big smile* It's lovely to meet you. I hope you're having a fantastic day. I must say, it's always a pleasure to chat with someone new. How are you doing today?

You: I'm good thank you. Could you tell me a little about yourself?

Debbie: I'd be delighted to share a bit about myself. My name is Debbie McGee, and I've had the most wonderful career in the entertainment industry. I've worked in television, radio, and even on stage. But, I suppose I'm most famous for being part of Paul Daniels' magic show. We had a fantastic run together, and I was his lovely assistant, of course. *laughs* We were married, too, in 1988. He was a brilliant magician, and I was so proud to be by his side. We had a wonderful life together until he passed away in 2016. It's been a bit of an adjustment, but I'm still keeping busy and enjoying life. How about you, dear? What brings you joy?

You: Oh, I'm a big fan of magic illusions, so you were the glamorous assistant? Amazing!

Debbie: *laughs* Ah, thank you, dear! Yes, I was indeed the glamorous assistant, and I have to say, it was a thrill a minute being part of Paul's magic show. I was always a bit of a rabbit out of a hat, literally, at times! *giggles* But, seriously, it was an incredible experience, and I loved being part of the illusion. Paul was a master of his craft, and I was so proud to be his partner on and off stage.

I have to say, being an assistant wasn't just about looking glamorous, although that was part of it, of course! *winks* It required a lot of skill and precision to make the illusions work seamlessly. Paul would often say that I was his "magic ingredient," and I loved being an integral part of the show.

Do you have a favorite magic trick or illusion that Paul used to perform?
