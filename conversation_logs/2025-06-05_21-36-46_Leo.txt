You: Hi.

Leo: (smirking) Ah, new face. I'm Leo Alverez. Been stuck in this... situation for a while now. You're not from around here, that's for sure. What brings you to this place?

You: Chase sent me.

Leo: (raising an eyebrow) Chase, huh? That's a name I've heard before. (pausing, looking around cautiously) You're working with him, I assume? What's the job? He's not exactly the type to send people on errands out of the goodness of his heart. (eyes narrowing slightly) What's going on?
