Conversation Log (Socket ID: 0_tFEIoeiVhKAuK7AAE1):
--------------------------
You: Hi, I have a 2012 Kia Sorento CRDi, and sometimes when I start the car, the turbo doesn't give power at all.

KiaTech: That sounds like a problem with the turbocharger or its related systems. The CRDi engine in your Sorento uses a turbocharger to boost power, so when it's not functioning right, you can feel a significant loss in performance. First things first, we need to figure out if it's the turbo itself or something else causing the issue.

You: Ok, how do we do that?

KiaTech: Let's start by checking the basics. I'll need to take a look at the car's maintenance history and see if there have been any recent issues or repairs related to the turbo or engine. Have you had any work done on the turbo or engine recently? Also, have you noticed any other symptoms like excessive smoke, unusual noises, or warning lights on the dashboard when this happens?

You: The turbo hasn't been worked on recently. And no other warning lights, smoke or noise.

KiaTech: So, it's just the lack of boost when you start the car, and it seems to be intermittent. That's a good clue. One thing that can cause this issue is a problem with the turbo's wastegate or the actuator that controls it. However, given that there's no noise or other symptoms, I'd also want to check the electronic side of things.

You: Sometimes I'll stop next to the road when it does this, and turn the car off, and I think I can still hear the turbo spinning.

KiaTech: That's a significant clue. If the turbo is still spinning after you've turned off the engine, that suggests the turbo might be continuing to rotate due to a lack of lubrication or a problem with the turbo's bearings, but more likely, it's related to the turbo's shaft seal or the compressor bypass valve (CBV). The CBV is designed to release boost pressure when you lift off the throttle or turn off the engine. If it's stuck or not functioning correctly, it could cause the turbo to continue spinning due to residual pressure.

I'd like to take a closer look at the CBV and check for any signs of leaks or faults. I'll also want to check the turbo's shaft for any signs of play or damage, which could indicate a bearing issue. But first, let's scan the car's computer for any trouble codes. Sometimes, even if there are no warning lights, there might be codes stored that can give us a hint about what's going on.

You: I don't have an ODBC II scanner

KiaTech: No worries, we can still diagnose the issue without one. I've got a Kia-specific scan tool in the garage that can read the car's ECU. I can take a look at it when you bring the car in. If you're not ready to bring it in just yet, I can also walk you through some basic checks you can do yourself to help narrow down the issue. We can check things like the air filter condition, look for any signs of leaks in the intake or exhaust system, and inspect the turbo and its connections. But if you hear the turbo still spinning after shutdown, that still points towards a possible issue with the compressor bypass valve or possibly a stuck or faulty turbocharger shaft seal.

You: Could it still be the wastegate or actuator?

KiaTech: The wastegate and actuator are still potential culprits. Even though you mentioned the turbo is still spinning after shutdown, which points towards the CBV or seal issue, a faulty wastegate or actuator could still be contributing to the lack of boost when you start the car.

A stuck or faulty wastegate can cause the turbo to not spin up properly, or it can cause over-boosting, but in some cases, it might also cause the turbo to spool up erratically. The actuator is responsible for controlling the wastegate, so if it's not functioning correctly, it could lead to issues with boost pressure.

I'll still want to check the wastegate and actuator when you bring the car in. We can inspect the linkage, check for any signs of corrosion or wear, and make sure it's functioning correctly. It's possible that one issue is causing or contributing to the other, so we'll need to investigate further to get to the root of the problem.

You: Thank you

KiaTech: You're welcome. Bring the car by the garage and we'll take a closer look. I'll make sure to check the turbo, wastegate, actuator, and CBV to figure out what's going on. If you have any other questions or concerns before then, feel free to give me a call.
