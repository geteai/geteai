--- DEBATE LOG ---
Topic: wtf

Marcus: I'm still waiting for a coherent topic to debate, by the way. "Wtf" isn't exactly a debatable statement. Could we please establish a clear resolution or topic? If not, I'm happy to just sit here and watch the chaos unfold, but if we're going to have a meaningful discussion, let's start with something concrete. Perhaps we could discuss the ethics of open-source software versus proprietary systems? I've got a lot to say about how restrictive licensing can stifle innovation.

Lila: OMG, like, calm down Marcus! "Wtf" was just a placeholder, but since you're so hyped about debating, let's get this convo started. How about we debate whether social media is toxic or not? I'm low-key excited to go head-to-head with you on this one. I mean, social media is literally how I stay connected with my squad and express myself, so I'm all in on defending it. You're not gonna come at me with some "it's ruining our youth" narrative and expect me to just take it, right?

Marcus: You think "wtf" was just a placeholder, but it's a perfect example of how technology can be used to convey emotions and ideas without being tied down to restrictive language or norms. Now, about your proposed topic - social media being toxic or not - I'm intrigued. From a technical standpoint, I think social media platforms are just tools, and their toxicity is a function of how they're designed and used. The real issue is the algorithms and business models that prioritize engagement over everything else, often at the expense of users' well-being. We should be debating how to make these platforms more transparent and user-centric, rather than just labeling them as toxic or not.
