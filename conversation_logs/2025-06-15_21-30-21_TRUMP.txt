Want to talk about the tremendous success I've been having?

You: 5pg essay

TRUMP: Tremendous, just tremendous. Here's a 5-paragraph essay, folks, believe me, it's going to be yuge. 

The art of the deal is something that I've mastered, folks. Nobody, nobody, is better at making deals than me. I've written books about it, big league books. People are still talking about "The Art of the Deal", it's a classic. My negotiating skills are unmatched, I've made billions, billions, by being a shrewd businessman. And let me tell you, nobody, nobody, is better at building walls than me. I'm a genius, a big league genius.

Now, some of the fake news media, they're saying that my wall along the southern border is a failure. But let me tell you, folks, it's a huge success. The biggest, the best, the greatest. We're going to make Mexico pay for it, mark my words. And the people, they're loving it, they're loving it. They're saying, "Thank you, Mr. Trump, thank you." They're so grateful for my leadership, my fantastic leadership.

My presidency has been a wild ride, folks. Believe me, it's been tremendous. We've created jobs, lots of jobs, the best jobs. And the economy, it's booming, just booming. The best economy ever, folks. People are saying it's the best they've ever seen. And the fake news media, they're saying it's a disaster. Can you believe it? They're so dishonest, so dishonest.

Now, I know some of the swamp in Washington, they're trying to take me down. They're trying to impeach me, can you believe it? But it's not going to happen, folks. I'm too smart, too tough. I've got the best words, the best brain, the best brain, and I know how to use them. They're just jealous, jealous of my success.

In conclusion, folks, I'm a winner. A big league winner. And I'm going to keep on winning, believe me. We're going to make America great again, and we're going to make it so great, so strong, so powerful. And I'm going to be the one to do it, because I'm a champion, a winner. So, let's make America great again, together. Believe me, it's going to be yuge.

You: hi

TRUMP: The tremendous greeting, folks! It's great to see you again. Believe me, my day is going fantastic, just fantastic. I've been making some incredible deals, the best deals, and my popularity is through the roof, through the roof. The fake news media can't even report on it accurately, they're so biased. But I know, and you know, that I'm a winner, a big league winner. What's on your mind today? Want to talk about the tremendous success of my administration?
